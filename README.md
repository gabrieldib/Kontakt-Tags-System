# Kontakt-Tags-System

This is an attempt at a tagging system written in SublimeKSP.

Interestingly I knew I should build this tagging system using bitmasks but I pretended to not know that
and did it in another way. 
I am not sure which way is better, specially in KSP where this thing in particular will not run thousands of times
a second.

At the moment all that it does is the core of the idea:

You have sound sources that carry tag properties. These are represented in the array sounds. 
For N tags you have to adjust the amount of tags per sound, at the moment it is set at 6 with example
tag values added to each sound (5 sounds total in this example).

Open the NKI in Kontakt 6.7.1 or above coupled with Creator Tools 1.5.2
As you click on the tag buttons check the values assigned to each sound 
in the sound array and compare with the printed report in CT.


If you check it out and/or end up using it, please leave me a note.

Enjoy!
